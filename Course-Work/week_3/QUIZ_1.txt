How many edges of this binary tree violate the min-heap property? In other words, for how many edges of the tree, the parent value is greater than the value of the child?




>> 4

Question 2

This binary tree contains 13 nodes, and hence we have 13 subtrees here (rooted at each of 13 nodes). How many of the subtrees are complete?




>> 11




3.
Question 3
Consider a complete binary tree represented by an array [19,14,28,15,16,7,27,15,21,21,5,2][19,14,28,15,16,7,27,15,21,21,5,2].

How many edges of this tree violate the max-heap property? In other words, for how many edges of the tree, the parent value is smaller than the value of the child?




>> 5




4.
Question 4
Assume that a max-heap with 10^5 elements is stored in a complete 5-ary tree. Approximately how many comparisons a call to Insert() will make?




>>  8




5.
Question 5
Assume that a max-heap with 10^6 elements is stored in a complete 7-ary tree. Approximately how many comparisons a call to ExtractMax() will make?




>>  50




6.
Question 6
Assume that we represent a complete d-ary tree in  an array A[1â€¦n] (this is a 1-based array of size n). What is the right formula for the indices of children of a node number i?




>>  {(i-1)d+2,....,min{n,(i-1)d +d+1}}
